## 📃 Description

The actual app designed to help coffee drinkers get a good night’s sleep by asking them three questions:
1. When do they want to wake up?
2. Roughly how many hours of sleep do they want?
3. How many cups of coffee do they drink per day?
   
Once the users answer these questions, they receive a result telling them when they should go to bed.
